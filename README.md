# Software Developer & Automation Engineer

I build smart and cost-effective software solutions that connect digital and industrial environments.  
My goal is to help businesses **automate processes, reduce costs, and unlock new digital opportunities** through customized applications and integrations.

 **What I do:**
- Web and API Development (Python, FastAPI, Flask, React, Node.js)
- Business Automation (Twilio, Selenium, AWS, CXML, WhatsApp Bots)
- System Integrations (B2B e-commerce, Ariba PunchOut, APIs)
- Industrial Automation & Data (Siemens PLC, C++, SQL/NoSQL)

 **Highlighted Projects:**
- **B2B PunchOut Integration (CXML/Ariba):** connected an electronics supplier with a major oil & gas buyer — exclusive B2B sales, zero hosting costs, +20% revenue potential.  
- **AeroCheap:** WhatsApp-based flight search bot — reduced ticket prices by 25% via automated scraping and real-time quotes.

 **Why clients work with me:**
- I focus on **results, simplicity, and low operational cost**.
- You get **direct, technical communication** (no intermediaries).
- All solutions are **scalable and transparent** — you own the code.

 Let’s discuss your next project — I’d love to help you design the right solution.
